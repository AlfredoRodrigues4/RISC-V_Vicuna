DPIP-1#1 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP vproc/u_core/u_ibex_core/ex_block_i/gen_multdiv_fast.multdiv_i/mac_res_signed input vproc/u_core/u_ibex_core/ex_block_i/gen_multdiv_fast.multdiv_i/mac_res_signed/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#2 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP vproc/u_core/u_ibex_core/ex_block_i/gen_multdiv_fast.multdiv_i/mac_res_signed input vproc/u_core/u_ibex_core/ex_block_i/gen_multdiv_fast.multdiv_i/mac_res_signed/B[17:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#3 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP vproc/u_core/u_ibex_core/ex_block_i/gen_multdiv_fast.multdiv_i/mac_res_signed input vproc/u_core/u_ibex_core/ex_block_i/gen_multdiv_fast.multdiv_i/mac_res_signed/C[47:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#1 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP vproc/u_core/u_ibex_core/ex_block_i/gen_multdiv_fast.multdiv_i/mac_res_signed output vproc/u_core/u_ibex_core/ex_block_i/gen_multdiv_fast.multdiv_i/mac_res_signed/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-2#1 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP vproc/u_core/u_ibex_core/ex_block_i/gen_multdiv_fast.multdiv_i/mac_res_signed multiplier stage vproc/u_core/u_ibex_core/ex_block_i/gen_multdiv_fast.multdiv_i/mac_res_signed/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-140#1 Warning

RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 u_ram/mem_reg_0_0_0 has an input control pin u_ram/mem_reg_0_0_0/ADDRARDADDR[14] (net: u_ram/ADDRBWRADDR[14]) which is driven by a register (vproc/u_core/u_ibex_core/cs_registers_i/priv_lvl_q_reg[0]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis.
